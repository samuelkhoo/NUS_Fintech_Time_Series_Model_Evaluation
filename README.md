# NUS Fintech Time Series Model Evaluation

For this semester project, we wanted to compare different time series models to determine which model would be best suited for stock price time series data. After conducting some research, we decided to test out these 3 models - LSTM, Decision Tree Regression, and Facebook's Prophet model.

You can find the code and results of each model in the respective folders. Feel free to comment on our methodology and code. We are still learning and feedback is appreciated!
